                              The attributes for the instance types. When you specify instance attributes,
                              Amazon EC2 will identify instance types with these attributes.

                              You must specify VCpuCount and MemoryMiB. All other attributes are optional.
                              Any unspecified optional attribute is set to its default.

                              When you specify multiple attributes, you get instance types that satisfy
                              all of the specified attributes. If you specify multiple values for an attribute,
                              you get instance types that satisfy any of the specified values.

                              To limit the list of instance types from which Amazon EC2 can identify matching
                              instance types, you can use one of the following parameters, but not both
                              in the same request:

                                 * AllowedInstanceTypes - The instance types to include in the list. All
                                 other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes.

                                 * ExcludedInstanceTypes - The instance types to exclude from the list,
                                 even if they match your specified attributes.

                              If you specify InstanceRequirements, you can't specify InstanceType.

                              Attribute-based instance type selection is only supported when using Auto
                              Scaling groups, EC2 Fleet, and Spot Fleet to launch instances. If you plan
                              to use the launch template in the launch instance wizard (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.html),
                              or with the RunInstances (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html)

                                  instance might go below the specified minimum at times. For more information,

                                Amazon EC2 will identify instance types with these attributes.

                                You must specify VCpuCount and MemoryMiB. All other attributes are optional.
                                Any unspecified optional attribute is set to its default.

                                When you specify multiple attributes, you get instance types that satisfy
                                all of the specified attributes. If you specify multiple values for an attribute,
                                you get instance types that satisfy any of the specified values.

                                To limit the list of instance types from which Amazon EC2 can identify matching
                                instance types, you can use one of the following parameters, but not both
                                in the same request:

                                   * AllowedInstanceTypes - The instance types to include in the list. All
                                   other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes.

                                   * ExcludedInstanceTypes - The instance types to exclude from the list,
                                   even if they match your specified attributes.

                                If you specify InstanceRequirements, you can't specify InstanceType.

                                Attribute-based instance type selection is only supported when using Auto
                                Scaling groups, EC2 Fleet, and Spot Fleet to launch instances. If you plan
                                to use the launch template in the launch instance wizard (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.html)

                                   other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes.

                                   * ExcludedInstanceTypes - The instance types to exclude from the list,
                                   even if they match your specified attributes.

                                If you specify InstanceRequirements, you can't specify InstanceType.

                                Attribute-based instance type selection is only supported when using Auto
