                  Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer
                  launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired
                  when it reaches its end date and time.

                  You must provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited. Omit EndDate
                  if EndDateType is unlimited.

                  If the EndDateType is limited, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within
                  an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55,
                  the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55

                    - limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified
                      date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if the EndDateType value
                      is limited.

                  The options include:

                      that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability
                      Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation
                      automatically without specifying any additional parameters.

                    - targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have
                      matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone),
                      and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only
