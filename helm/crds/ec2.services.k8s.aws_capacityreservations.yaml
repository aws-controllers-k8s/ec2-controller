                     * cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was canceled. The reserved capacity
                     is no longer available for your use.

                     * pending - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the capacity
                     provisioning is still pending.

                     * failed - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A request can
                     fail due to request parameters that are not valid, capacity constraints,
                     or instance limit constraints. You can view a failed request for 60 minutes.

                     a delay in provisioning the requested future-dated Capacity Reservation.
                     Amazon EC2 is unable to deliver the requested capacity by the requested

                     support the future-dated Capacity Reservation request due to capacity
                     constraints. You can view unsupported requests for 30 days. The Capacity
